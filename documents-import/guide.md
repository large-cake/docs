# Documents #

## Concepts ##

All documents are versioned. Each version of the file is preserved in the itâ€™s original form. Each version of the document has a set of metadata properties. Document has at least one version and would be assigned either against client or contact, optionally marked against combination of assignment code and assignment job and would have author and date created. Additional metadata properties can be included on request.
